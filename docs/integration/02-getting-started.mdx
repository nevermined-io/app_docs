# Getting Started

## Select which library flavor to use

Depending on your programming language and where you want to integrate the library, you can choose
between the Python or TypeScript library:

- **Python**: GitHub repository
  [nevermined-io/payments-py](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py) and
  [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/payments-py/)
- **TypeScript**: GitHub repository
  [nevermined-io/payments](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments) and
  [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nevermined-io/payments)

:::info 
Both Payments libraries implementations are Open Source
([Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). 
:::

## Requirements

### Get a Nevermined API Key

To use the Payments libraries you need to
[create a Nevermined API Key](../tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys). This key will allow you to
interact with the Nevermined platform and create Payment Plans and Agents.

The Nevermined API Key must be created in the environment where you will run your application. For
example, if you are running a Python application connected to the **"testing"**, you need to create
the API Key in the [Nevermined Testing App](https://testing.nevermined.app/) but if you want to use
the Live environment you must use the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app/).

:::warning 
You need to keep your API Key secure and never share it with anyone.

## Install the library

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="python">```python pip install payments-py ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript">```typescript npm install @nevermined-io/payments ```</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize the Payments instance

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'typescript'},
    {label: 'TypeScript (Browser)', value: 'browser'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="python">
  ```python
  # @see https://docs.nevermined.app/docs/tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys
  nvm_api_key = 'eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ.ey .....'

# If you want to connect to production use 'live' as environment

payments = Payments(nvm_api_key, environment=Environment.get_environment('sandbox'))

````
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">
```typescript
// To get your own Nevermined API Key, follow the instructions here:
// https://docs.nevermined.app/docs/tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys
const nvmApiKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ.ey .....'

# If you want to connect to production use 'live' as environment
const payments = Payments.getInstance({
  nvmApiKey,
  environment: 'sandbox',
})
````

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="browser">
  ```typescript
  // If you want to connect to production use 'live' as environment
  const payments = Payments.getBrowserInstance({
    returnUrl: 'https://mysite.example.com',
    environment: 'sandbox'
  })
  payments.connect()
  ```
