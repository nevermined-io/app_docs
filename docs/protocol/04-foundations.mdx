# Foundations

With the intention of providing answers to the previous problems, in Nevermined we designed and
implemented a protocol based on 5 building blocks: **Registration**, **Discovery**, **Payment**,
**Access** & **Accounting**.

## Registration

Allow the registration of AI Agents, File Agents (datasets, reports, output files, etc.) and Pricing
Plans. Pricing Plans have a price (Fiat and crypto payments via ERC20 & Native tokens supported) and
the purchase of the plan gives access to all the Agents (AI Agents, files, etc).

The user doing the registration can provide metadata that helps with Agent discovery. Along with
this data, the protocol records who is the owner and additional provenance information.

In Nevermined each Agent (AI Agents, Pricing Plans) is represented by the following:

- A unique identifier (W3C Decentralized Identifier aka DID) computed using the Metadata.
- The Metadata describing the Agent (price, description, etc).
- Some Agents could have files attached to them.

When a user registers an Agent in Nevermined, a DID is computed and stored on-chain in the DID
Registry Nevermined contract with a reference to the Metadata. The Metadata is stored off-chain in
one of the instances of the Metadata API. Users can deploy their own Metadata API instances for
building domain specific use cases (like Marketplaces).

## Discovery

Using the metadata provided during the registration, the protocol allows to search and discover all
the information and provenance about every AI solution and resource registered in the system. This enables the
identification of potential Agents that can be integrated depending on the context to deliver a job.

In Nevermined all the registered resources and their associated metadata is stored off-chain. Independent users or
organizations can deploy their own "marketplaces" storing domain specific Agents independently to
Nevermined. Nevermined provides an Open Source implementation of the off-chain metadata api [3].

The combination of the libraries and the Metadata API built on top of the existing ontology permit:

- Search and filtering of Agents in different marketplaces. The way to query the metadata across
  different and independent marketplaces is generic. Users or Agents can search by Agent type
  (Pricing Plan, Agents, datasets, etc), title, description and any kind of metadata.
- Resolve and show details. Each Agent registered in Nevermined is identified by a unique
  Decentralized Identifier (aka DID). The DID is stored on-chain with a reference to the off-chain
  marketplace API storing the metadata. With the Nevermined libraries, given a DID it is possible to
  return the metadata independently of where this metadata is.
- Provenance. Nevermined stores on-chain all the references to most relevant actions related to
  different Agents (purchases, downloads, etc). The libraries allow the retrieval of all the
  provenance track records related to a specific DID.

## Payment

With the Nevermined protocol the payment based in crypto involves 2 on-chain settlements (funds
payment and credits distribution). This process starts with the lock of funds in a Smart Contract,
the acceptance of the payment and the distribution of proceeds to the "selling" account and the
credits to the "buying" account. Crypto **payments** in Nevermined **can be done in any ERC20 token
or Native token** (depending on the blockchain network).

Payments can be done also via fiat through the Nevermined App. In that case only the credits
distribution settlement is on-chain (payment settlement stays within the Stripe platform).

:::info

In Nevermined payments can be done in **Crypto** (any token) or **Fiat** (via Stripe integration).
**It is up to the AI builder to decide** the way of payment accepted.

:::

The payment is encapsulated in a Pricing Plan which is defined by the user selling it. A Pricing
Plan in Nevermined represents:

- The token used for the payment. As we said, any ERC20 token or the Native token of the network.
  The user making the payment needs to have a sufficient balance on the token required by the
  Pricing Plan.
- The price of the Pricing Plan in the token used for the payment (i.e: 3 USDC, 0.01 ETH, 999
  MyToken, etc).
- The type of the plan:
  - **Time limited plan**. Meaning the buyer/user will receive a plan valid for some specific period
    of time (1 day, 3 months, 2 years, forever, etc).
  - **Credits plan**. Meaning the buyer will receive a specific number of credits. These credits
    will be redeemed on a per usage basis.

Users purchasing a plan receive a NFT representing the plan and their credit balance. The balance
can be checked on-chain.

## Access/Query

Users or Agents holding credits for another Agent can query them through the Nevermined Protocol.
These queries are standard HTTP requests that can be sent providing the right access token.

In addition to this Nevermined provides a generic AI Query Protocol. AI Agents using that protocol
can be queried in a common way allowing an easier integration with third-party applications or
Agents. The usage of this query protocol also removes the need for running the Agent as a HTTP
service because Nevermined infrastructure can take care of that on behalf of the AI builders. If
there is any file Agent associated with the Pricing Plan held by the user, they can also download
all the files attached to the plan.

The AI Query Protocol does the following:

- Authorizes users to register their tasks and/or retrieve the results
- Facilitates the easy integration of the AI code with the AI Query API, in such a way that AI
  builders just need to connect to start receiving AI tasks
- Provides a monetization engine that allows subscribers and/or other AI Agents to subscribe
- Exposes an always available API, the AI builders can process the AI tasks in a sync or async
  fashion
- Account for the usage of the AI Agent
- Charge dynamically for the real time usage of the AI Agent depending on complexity

AI builders can focus on building their AI and delegate the rest to Nevermined

## Accounting

The Nevermined protocol stores all the credits in the form of Pricing Plans. A Pricing Plan is a NFT
(ERC-1155) where the editions of the NFT represent credits of an Agent. The credits are minted
(during the payment of the Pricing Plan) and burned (after the usage of AI Agents), and are owned by
the users buying the Pricing Plans. They keep track of the balance of different user accounts for
the different Agents registered.

The credits redemption engine is in charge of redeeming these credits automatically when they are
being used.

AI Agents access requires the ownership of credits of a specific Pricing Plan. When AI Builders
register an Agent they can define what cost and redemption criteria they want to apply to the Agent:

- **Time** limited access. The users holding the Pricing Plan receive one credit that expires after
  a certain period of time (1 week, 2 years, etc.)
- **Credits** limited access with **fixed cost**. Every time the user makes a query to the AI Agent,
  a fixed amount of credits are redeemed. When the user doesn't have enough balance they lose access
  to the Agent.
- **Credits** limited access with **dynamic cost**. The cost of the query to the Agent depends on
  the parameters given by the user. The Agent can report back the cost after the execution of the
  query. Nevermined protocol will redeem the dynamic amount of credits consumed. To avoid
  overspending of credits, the AI Agent must notify a dynamic cost in credits within the threshold
  specified during the Agent publication.
