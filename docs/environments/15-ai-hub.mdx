# Nevermined AI Hub

## Introduction

The Nevermined AI Hub (aka AI Hub or Hub) is a set of infrastructure and AI services provided by
Nevermined to simplify the delivery of AI Agents and services for developers.

## Benefits 

The AI Hub provides:

* A backend API implementing the
  [Nevermined Query Protocol](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/protocol/query-protocol). This backend provides the REST API for querying any AI Agent, allowing AI Builders to focus on the AI implementation rather than API development.
* Access control. Only subscribed users with valid Payment Plans can send Tasks to an Agent.
* Dynamic cost calculation for user queries based on AI Task complexity. The AI Agent reports the cost in credits for individual Steps composing the task via the **cost** attribute. The total task cost cannot exceed the pre-defined maximum.
* Automatic usage accounting. Subscribers sending Tasks to the Agent are charged credits for their Tasks. Access is restricted when available credits are depleted, requiring a top-up to continue using the Agent.
* Task orchestration. The backend allows AI builders to define their workflow of Steps and receive them in the correct order. The backend marks Tasks as **Completed** when all Steps are successful, or **Failed** if any Step fails.

## How an AI Builder can use the AI Hub?

Using the AI Hub is straightforward. An AI Builder needs to:

1. Get their own [Nevermined API Key](../tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys)
2. Install the [Payments library](../libraries/) in their project
3. Integrate with the AI Hub to start [processing AI Tasks](../libraries/process-tasks)
4. [Register the new AI Agent](../tutorials/builders/register-agent) into a Nevermined deployment

When using the AI Hub, builders can focus on their agents' AI logic and delegate API execution to Nevermined. 
The AI agent is divided into 2 parts:

1. The **AI Agent Processor**: The AI logic that processes user input prompts using one or several LLM models or services to generate output.
2. The **AI HTTP API**: The component that handles input prompts, authenticates users, validates subscriptions, and manages communication between users and the AI Agent Processor.

Using the **Nevermined AI Hub**, builders can focus on the AI Agent Processor while delegating API execution to Nevermined, resulting in simplified agent architecture.
