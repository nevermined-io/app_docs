# Nevermined AI Hub

## Introduction

The Nevermined AI Hub (aka AI Hub or Hub) is a set of infrastructure and AI services provided by
Nevermined with the intention of making simpler the delivery of AI Agents and services for
developers.

## Benefits 

The AI Hub provides:

* A backend API implementing the
  [Nevermined Query Protocol](https://docs.nevermined.io/docs/protocol/query-protocol). This backend can provide the REST API for querying any AI Agent. So AI Builders don't need to define and build the API themselves and focus on the AI piece.
* Access control. Only users that are subscsribers for the Payment Plan giving access to the Agent can send Tasks to it.
* Dynamic cost of the queries of the users depending on the AI Tasks complexity. The AI Agent can report back the cost in credits of the individual Steps composing the task returning back the **cost** attribute. The total cost of the task can not go over the maximum cost pre-defined in the task.
* Automatic accounting for the usage of the Agent. Subscribers sending Tasks to the Agent will be charged in credits for their Tasks. When they use all the credits they have available the access will be restricted, so if they want to continue using the Agent they must topup.
* Orchestration of tasks. The backend allow AI builders to define their workflow of Steps and receive the Steps to process in the right order. When all the Steps resolving a Task are **Completed**, the backend will complete the whole Task successfully. If any of the Steps fails, the backend will complete the whole Task as **Failed**.

## How an AI Builder can use the AI Hub?

Using the AI Hub it's simple. An AI Builder just needs to:

1. Get their own [Nevermined API Key](../tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys)
2. Install the [Payments library](../libraries/) in their project
3. Integrate with the AI Hub to start [processing AI Tasks](../libraries/process-tasks)
4. [Register the new AI Agent](../tutorials/builders/register-agent) into a Nevermined deployment

When using the AI Hub, builders can focus in the AI logic of their agents and delegate the execution of the API to Nevermined. 
In that case the AI agent will be divided in 2 parts:

1. What we call **the AI Agent Processor**. It's the AI logic which having an input prompt from the user uses one or several LLM models or services to generate an output.
2. The **AI HTTP API**. It's the part of the agent that receives the input prompt, authenticate the user and validates is a valid subscriber. If everything is okay it sends the input prompt to the AI Agent Processor. It also receives the output from the AI Agent Processor and sends it back to the user.

Using the **Nevermined AI Hub** the Builder can focus in the AI Agent Processor and delegate the execution of the API to Nevermined. That simplifies the agent architecture.
