# Network Fees

Nevermined provides infrastructure that enables content publishers and users to negotiate digital assets in a secure and trustless manner. 

To maintain this service, Nevermined Point of Sales charges a **1% fee** on all monetary transactions. This fee is automatically included when subscription rewards are distributed at the time of sale.

For free assets or subscriptions, no fee is charged.

## Stripe Fees

When purchasing a subscription with fiat currency, the App uses Stripe as the payment processor. In addition to the Nevermined fee, Stripe charges its own processing fee. The exact Stripe fee will be displayed to AI builders when they create a new subscription.
