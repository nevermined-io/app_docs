# Network Fees

Nevermined provides the infrastructure to content publishers and users to negotiate around their digital assets in a secure a trustless manner. 

To continue to provide this service, the Nevermined Smart Contracts charge a **1 % fee** on all monetary transactions. This fee is included in the distribution of rewards, when a subscription is sold.

There is no minimum fee, so if the asset is traded for free, it's not necessary to factor in payment.
