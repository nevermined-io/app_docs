# Network Fees

Nevermined provides the infrastructure to content publishers and users to negotiate around their digital assets in a secure and trustless manner. 

To continue to provide this service, Nevermined Point of Sales charge a **1 % fee** on all monetary transactions. This fee is included in the distribution of rewards, when a subscription is sold.

There is no minimum fee, so if the asset is traded for free, it's not necessary to factor in payment.

## Stripe fee

When the purchase of a subscription is done using fiat, the App integrates Stripe to facilitate that payment. A part of the Nevermined fee, Stripe will deduct their fee. Stripe fee to charged will be displayed in the moment the AI builder creates a new subscription.
