# Environments

Nevermined Point of Sales App is available in a [production](https://nevermined.app/) and in a [testing](https://testing.nevermined.app/) environment. 
Both environments are opened and ready to use, the main difference is in [production](https://nevermined.app/) environment is where users can publish and receive payments with real money.

Testing environment is specially useful for AI builders to start getting a better sense of the Point of Sales application.

:::info

In [testing](https://testing.nevermined.app/) environment all the payments are not using real money.

:::


A part of these environments we have **Headless Deployments** where we don't provide a Nevermined App **BUT** the underlying network is available. This deployments are specially oriented to **Agent2Agent** communication and orchestration.
