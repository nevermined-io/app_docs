# Nevermined Public Environments

Nevermined App is available in different networks/environments for users to make use of this application without the complexity of dealing with the technology.

Existing networks have different characteristics related to the underlying blockchain network being used and whether they are a production or a test environment.

## Blockchain networks supported

Nevermined Smart Contracts are EVM compatible so they can be deployed on any EVM compatible blockchain. Currently we support deployments on:

- **Ethereum**
- **Polygon**
- **Arbitrum**

:::info

We are planning to augment the list of supported networks. If you need to use Nevermined on any other network, please let us know [through Discord](https://discord.gg/GZju2qScKq).
