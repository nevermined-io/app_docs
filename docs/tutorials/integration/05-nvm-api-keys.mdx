# What is a Nevermined API Key? How to obtain it and how to use it

A Nevermined API Key is the simplest way to integrate with the Nevermined ecosystem. It's a string
that contains data that identifies the session key of the account abstraction and some extra data such as
the marketplace auth token. It works similar to a JWT but for blockchain accounts. You can find more information
in the [zeroDev docs](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/advanced/session-keys).

## How to obtain a Nevermined API Key

1. Go to the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app/) or the
   [Testing Nevermined App](https://testing.nevermined.app/).

2. Click on the `Account` button on the top right corner.

4. Select a name and choose the permissions that you want to assign to the session key. Sign the
   session key. It will take some seconds.
