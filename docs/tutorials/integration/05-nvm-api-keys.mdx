# What is a Nvm Api Key? How to obtain it and how to use it

A Nevermined Api key is the simpler way to integrate with the Nevermined ecosystem. It's a string that contains data that identifies the session key of the account abstraction and some extra data as the marketplace auth token. It works similar to a jwt but for blockchain accounts. You can find more in [zeroDev docs](https://docs.zerodev.app/sdk/plugins/session-keys).

## How to obtain a Nvm Api Key

1. Go to the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app/) or the [Testing Nevermined App](https://testing.nevermined.app/).

2. Click on the `Account` button on the top right corner.
