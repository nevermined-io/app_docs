# Searching assets and buying subscriptions

The Nevermined marketplace allows you to browse, search and purchase access to any of the assets that have been registered. 

## Before you start
Currently, the Nevermined App works on the Polygon, Gnosis and Arbitrum networks. 
In order to purchase assets on that network you need to:

1. Connect your Metamask wallet to network that the asset has been registered on (instructions [here](02-metamask.md)).
2. Get some tokens to pay for the network transactions fees on that network. You can find instructions [here](02-metamask-tokens.md).
3. You will need USDC to pay for the subscription. Again, check the [How to get tokens tutorial](02-metamask-tokens.md). 

## How to buy a Smart Subscription for the asset you want

The Marketplace is where you find and purchase the asset you're interested in. 
Navigate to the marketplace via Home or by clicking Marketplace in the footer. 

### 1. Find the asset you're interested in

The marketplace has different ways to find assets.
* Use the search field to type in keywords related to the title of the asset.
* Use the filter function to restrict your search to certain assets types, subscription durations, tags,...

### 2. Get more detailed information

Click on 'Learn More' to go to an overview page of the asset, including: 
* the description provided by the publisher
* some on-chain meta-data
* the price and duration of the subscription you can purchase

If this is the asset you want, simply click the Buy button.

### 4. Sign the transactions

First, it is possible that your MetaMask wallet asks you to approve a spending cap for USDC.

After that, you have to confirm your purchase (and the small gas fee).

After a short wait you will see a confirmation message. Click on 'Dashboard' to manage the asset you've now bought access to.
