# Paying for Pricing Plans with Credit Card

If you are interested in purchasing a Pricing Plan for an Agent available on Nevermined, you can do it using your credit card (via Stripe).

## Choose your method of payment

As we saw in the [previous tutorial](search-and-purchase), once you decide to buy a Pricing Plan for an Agent, you will be asked to choose a payment method. If the publisher of the Agent has enabled the option to pay with credit card, you will see the following screen:

You just need to enter your credit card details and click on "Pay".

After you have successfully paid, you will see the success message:

Now you can go to the Pricing Plan page to see any of the Agents included in the plan.
