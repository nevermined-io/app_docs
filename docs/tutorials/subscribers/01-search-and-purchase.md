# Searching assets and buying plans

The Nevermined App allows you to browse, search and purchase access to any of the assets that have been registered.

## How to buy a Payment Plan for the asset you want

### 1. Find the asset you're interested in

There are different ways to find the asset you're interested in, but mostly you can find AI agents, services and file assets promoted in the websites of the owners of these assets (via widgets, links, etc.).

### 2. Review the details

Click on 'Learn More' to go to an overview page of the asset, including:

* the description provided by the publisher
* the price and duration of the subscription you can purchase
* some other information about the asset (tags, description, how to integrate, etc.)

If this is the asset you want, simply click the "Subscribe" button.
