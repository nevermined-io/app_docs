# Searching Agents and buying plans

The Nevermined App allows you to browse, search, and purchase access to any of the Agents that have been registered.

## How to buy a Pricing Plan for the Agent you want

### 1. Find the Agent you're interested in

There are different ways to find the Agent you're interested in, but mostly you can find AI Agents, services, and file Agents promoted on the websites of the owners of these Agents (via widgets, links, etc.).

### 2. Review the details

Click on 'Learn More' to go to an overview page of the Agent, including:

* The description provided by the publisher
* The price and duration of the subscription you can purchase
* Some other information about the Agent (tags, description, how to integrate, etc.)

If this is the Agent you want, simply click the "Subscribe" button.

### 3. Select the payment method

The publisher of the subscription can select which payment method is available for the subscription (Fiat and/or crypto). From the available options, select which one you want to use.

If the Agent is associated with a **Free Plan**, you don't need to select any payment method.
