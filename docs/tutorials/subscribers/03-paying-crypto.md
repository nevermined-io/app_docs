# Paying for Pricing Plans with Crypto

If you are interested in purchasing a Pricing Plan for an Agent available on Nevermined, you can do it using Crypto.

## Choose your method of payment

As we saw in the [previous tutorial](search-and-purchase), once you decide to buy a Pricing Plan for an Agent, you will be asked to choose a payment method. If the publisher of the Agent has enabled the option to pay with crypto, you will see the following screen:

You just need to agree to the Terms and Conditions and click on "Complete Purchase".

To complete the purchase you need to have **enough funds in USDC** in your wallet (Arbitrum One or Sepolia for testing).
