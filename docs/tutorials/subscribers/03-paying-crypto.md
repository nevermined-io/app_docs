# Paying plans with Crypto

If you are interested in getting a plan to an asset available on Nevermined, you can do it using Crypto.

## Choose your method of authentication

As we saw in the [previous tutorial](search-and-purchase), once you decided to buy a plan to an asset, you will be asked to choose a payment method. If the publisher of the asset has enabled the option to pay with crypto, you will see the following screen:

You just need agree to the Term and Conditions and click on "Complete Purchase".

To complete the purchase you need to have **enough funds in USDC** in your wallet (Arbitrum One or Sepolia for testing).

Now you can go to the Payment Plan page to see any of the assets included into the plan.
