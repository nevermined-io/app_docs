# Configure your account to accept payments

If you are an AI builder and you plan to publish AI services in the app, first you need to configure your account to accept payments. 
Do that is very simple:

## 1. Go to the "My Account" section

You can do it by clicking in "My Area" > "My Account" top menu.

## 2. Complete your profile information

In the "Profile" page you should at least complete your name and email address. When you are done click on the "Save profile" button.

## 3. Select your preferred payment method

You will be able to configure your prefered ways to receive payments (fiat via Stripe integration and/or crypto). 
If you just want to accept crypto payments, no further configuration needs to be done, any potential payment will be received in the unique wallet address associated with your account. You can see your wallet address if you click on the top right corner of the app, section "My Wallet".

Remember to click on the "Save profile" button if you make any change.

## 4. Configure the fiat payment method

If you want to accept fiat payments, you need to configure the Stripe integration. This will allow subscribers to pay with their credit card and you will receive the payment in your Stripe account.

If that's the case you need to click on the Stripe checkbox and click on the "Save profile" button. A message with the text will show saying your profile is not ready. This is because you need to connect with Stripe to create your account (or use the one yoe have already).

As in the above image, you will see a new button called "Create Stripe account". Click on it and you will be redirected to Stripe website. Stripe will ask about information of your business and the bank account where you want to receive your payments. Once you have created your account, you will be redirected back to the app and you will see a success message.

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a third party service that allows you to accept fiat payments. Stripe will charge a fee for any payment processed.

Once you have created your Stripe account, you will see a message saying your profile is ready to accept payments.
