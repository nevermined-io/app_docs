# Configure your account to accept payments

If you are an AI builder and you plan to get paid for your AI services using the Nevermined app, first you need to configure your account to accept payments. 
The process is very simple:

:::info

To activate your account to accept payments, you need to complete your profile information (name, email, country of residence) and select your preferred payment method.

:::

## 1. Go to the "Profile" section

You can do this by clicking on "My Area" > "Profile" in the top menu.

## 3. Select your preferred payment method

You can configure your preferred method to receive payments: via Stripe integration for fiat and/or crypto. 

(Please Note: If you just want to accept crypto payments, no further configuration is needed. Any crypto payment will be received in the unique wallet address associated with your account. You can see your wallet address if you click on the top right corner of the app, in the "My Wallet" section.)

If you want to accept fiat payments, you need to add a Stripe account. Once configured, your users will be able to subscribe by paying with their credit card, and you will receive the payment in your Stripe account.



To proceed, click on the Stripe checkbox. A message will appear saying your profile is not ready. This is because you need to connect with Stripe to create your account (or link a Stripe account that you have already created).

As shown in the above image, you will see a new button called "Create Stripe account". Click on it and you will be redirected to the Stripe account setup website. Stripe will ask for information about you and/or your business and the bank account where you want to receive your payments, etc. Once you have created your account, you will be redirected back to the app and you will see a success message.

:::info

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a third-party service that allows you to accept fiat payments. Stripe will charge a fee for any payment processed.

:::

Once you have created your Stripe account, you will see a message saying your profile is ready to accept payments.
