# Distribute your AI services and files and make some money

In previous tutorials we showed [how to create a Smart Subscription](create-subscription), [how to register a dataset](register-file-asset) and [how to register an AI service](register-webservice). Now it's time to distribute your AI services and files and make some money.

Go to the "Published" tab of the "My Assets" view to get an overview of your AI Agents/Services and file assets.Use the filter on the "Search" tab if you need it.

The different assets published can be identified by the information you provide (title, images, etc.) and the type of asset (Service, Dataset, etc.).

## Promote your AI services

Click on the AI Service to go the Asset Details page (click on the eye icon).

Share this URL with potential buyers. They can use the 'Subscribe' button to purchase directly from you. In addition, people can also automatically discover your AI web service in the App Marketplace.

## Promote via widgets

Just click on the three dots icon and select "Edit Widget".
