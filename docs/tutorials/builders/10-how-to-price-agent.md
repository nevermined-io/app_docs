# How to price your AI Agent

With Nevermined is possible to monetize any AI Agent you create. But pricing it correctly is key to make it a successful business can be challenging. For doing that you need to take into consideration several factors:

1. What LLMs or models are you using?
2. Is your agent using any additional service or data?
3. Is your agent using a lot of infrastucture resources? In the Cloud? GPUs?
4. What's the architecture of your agent? Is it a simple model or a complex one? Is a prompt or query to agent cascading into multiple steps going across different models?

<br />
A complete analysis of these factors will help you to price your AI Agent correctly. Having that you can continue with the following steps:

1. Understand what's the average cost of the different models and services per query.
2. Understand what's the fixed cost of running the agent (for example the monthly cost of the infrastructure).
3. For regular interactions/simple/complex interactions with your agent, how it looks the execution plan. It means how many queries to the models are needed and the complex they are.
4. Estimate the normal distribution of these queries. For example assuming 50% are simple queries, 30% are complex queries and 20% are very complex queries.
5. With all the above create an estimation of the cost per interaction with your agent, and add some margin to it.
6. Map the cost per interaction to credits and the final price of the plan.
