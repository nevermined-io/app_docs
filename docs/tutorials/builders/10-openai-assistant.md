# Monetize your Open AI Assistant

With Nevermined is possible to monetize any assistant you created via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants). In previous tutorials we showed [how to register an AI service](register-webservice). Now it's time to distribute and monetize a different type of an AI Service, in this case an OpenAI assistant.

## From where can I copy the Assistant ID?

The Assistant ID is a unique identifier for your assistant. You can find it in the [Assistant dashboard of OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants). The Assistant ID is the value starting by `asst_` in the ID column. For example: `asst_m3hDiBSEScF4vTyeGGJ8JI8T`.

## From where can I copy Open AI access token?

The Open AI access token or  secret API Key is the token that allows to use your assistant remotely. We recommend to create a new one from the [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) page.
