# How to register your file assets and link to a Payment Plan

Here we go through the required steps of registering a new dataset and link it to your Payment Plan. Owners who purchase that plan will get access to the one or more file assets that are included in the plan.

:::note
You can't register an asset without first configuring a Payment Plan. So if you skipped that part, please go to the tutorial about [How to create a Payment Plan](create-plan) first.
:::

In Nevermined you can register different types of file assets:

* Datasets
* Models
* Media files
* Software/Algorithms
* Any other kind of file

The registration of any of those is very similar. In this tutorial we will focus on datasets, but the process is the same for any other type of file asset.

## How to register a dataset

These are the steps to make your dataset available to holders of your Payment Plan.

If you don't want to read the whole tutorial, you can watch the video tutorial:

</p>

### 1. Open the New Asset page

* Click on the New button in the top right to go the New Asset page.
* Click on the “Create Asset” button of the Dataset or any other box.

### 2. Describe your data asset

#### Provide a short title

#### Add a description

For example:

* Aggregate dataset about hair loss research. Done by Dr. Whig. Conducted in 2021, with 3500 Spanish males.
* A CSV file containing the lyrics of these 43 Elvis songs: Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock,...

#### Include tags

Add tags to help buyers find your Data set(s) in the Nevermined marketplace. Click the '+' symbol to add new tags.

### 3. Upload the files and additional information

#### Upload files

Drag & drop or browse in your local computer to upload your dataset. Note: a dataset can have multiple files associated to it. Any file format is permitted.

#### Data schema (for datasets only)

If you are publishing a **dataset** the App will ask you to provide some information about the data schema. This is very useful for potential buyers to understand the structure of your dataset.
Describe the structure of your dataset: fields, field types, number records, etc

#### Upload a cover image (optional)

You have the option to add a visual that gives more info about your Data Asset, e.g. an image of the research institute which generated the dataset.

#### Upload sample data files (optional)

If you have sample files or addional information that you want to share with potential buyers, you can upload them here. These files will be openly available to anyone who visits your asset page.

### 4. Choose the Payment Plan

Next, you need to specify what type of plan a user requires to get access to your dataset. 

:::tip
If you want your data set to be available via different plans, you can go through this process once more. 
Register the asset again and add it to another Payment Plan. For now ;-)

### 5. Review everything is okay

Finally, review your data plan. Click on “Create” if everything looks good. Or go “Back” if you want to modify anything.

### 6. Dataset registration

The Nevermined App will register the new AI agent. This will take just a few seconds and once it's done, you will see a success message.
