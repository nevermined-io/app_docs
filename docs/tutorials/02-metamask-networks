# How to add networks to MetaMask

Nevermined is currently available on 3 blockchain networks. 
- Polygon
- Gnosis
- Arbitrum

Depending on your the network you prefer to use, you need to add the following network data to your MetaMask extension. 

For testing, we have also deployed the application on the following testnets. Using these networks has the benefit you can try the application while using 'test tokens' (without any value) to pay for transaction fees. 
- Mumbai (for Polygon)
- Chiado (for Gnosis)
- Goerli (for Arbitrum)


## Get Ready
Before you add any of these networks, make sure you are logged in to your MetaMask 
Go to the extension menu in your browser, click on the Metamask icon and login to your MetaMask wallet.


## Step 1: Go to 'Add Network'

- Click the Circle icon in the top right corner of the app. 
- From the drop down menu select "Settings".
