# How to add funds to your Metamask wallet

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It can be accessed through an app or through a browser extension.

## Steps

### Step 1: Download MetaMask wallet

Go to [Metamask Website](https://metamask.io/) and click on “Download”. Choose your preferred browser or mobile application and install the MetaMask extension.
MetaMask supports iOS, Android native apps along with Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Edge browser extensions.

### Step 2: Create a new MetaMask wallet

Click on “Create a Wallet” and on the next window click on “I agree” if you would like to help improve MetaMask or click on “No Thanks” to proceed.


### Step 3: Create a strong password for your wallet


### Step 4: Securely store the seed phrase for your wallet

Click on “Click here to reveal secret words” to show the seed phrase.
! MetaMask requires that you store your seed phrase in a safe place. It is the only way to recover your funds should your device crash or your browser reset. We recommend you write it down. The most common method is to write your 12-word phrase on a piece of paper and store it safely in a place where only you have access. Note: if you lose your seed phrase, MetaMask can’t help you recover your wallet and your funds will be lost forever.
! Never share your seed phrase or your private key to anyone or any site, unless you want them to have full control over your funds.
