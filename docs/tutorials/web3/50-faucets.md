# Getting tokens for testnets

## Testnets

For testing purposes, we have also deployed the application on the following testnets. Using these networks has the benefit you can try the application while using 'test tokens' (without any value) to pay for transaction fees.

Note that you shouldn't register your real assets, as they will become available in the App. 

- [Testing](https://testing.nevermined.app/) (for Arbitrum) (**prefered for testing**)
- [Mumbai](https://mumbai.nevermined.app) (for Polygon)
- [Chiado](https://chiado.nevermined.app) (for Gnosis)
  
## Getting tokens for Sepolia, the testnet for Arbitrum

To publish a Payment Plan (and the associated AI web service or Data) you need some Arbitrum ETH, to pay for the network transaction fees.

### Getting testnet ETH

[https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia) dispenses a small amount of ETH.

- Select Arbitrum and Sepolia from the dropdowns.
- Connect your MetaMask to complete the wallet address field.
- Optionally you can tweet to double the amount of test `ETH` you will receive.
(note: the faucet might say ARB, but your MetaMask will say ETH ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

## Getting tokens for Mumbai, the testnet for Polygon

To publish a Payment Plan (and the associated AI web service or Data) you need some MATIC, to pay for the network transaction fees. 

### Getting testnet MATIC

Faucets are applications where you can claim some (valueless) test tokens. 
For Mumbai, you can use https://faucet.polygon.technology or https://faucet.quicknode.com/

- Go to the MetaMask extension in your browser.
- Hover over your account and copy your wallet address (starting with 0x)
- Paste it in the Wallet Address Field

## Getting testnet USDC 

Getting USDC in Sepolia (or any other testnet network) is quick and simple. Just visit the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), select Arbitrum Sepolia (or any other network) and paste your address. You can get 10 USDC per day.
