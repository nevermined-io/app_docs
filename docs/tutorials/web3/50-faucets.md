# Getting tokens for testnets

## Testnets

For testing purposes, we have also deployed the application on the following testnets. Using these networks has the benefit that you can try the application while using 'test tokens' (without any value) to pay for transaction fees.

Note that you shouldn't register your real Agents, as they will become available in the App. 

- [Testing](https://testing.nevermined.app/) (for Arbitrum)
  
## Getting tokens for Sepolia, the testnet for Arbitrum

To publish a Pricing Plan (and the associated AI web service or Data) you need some Arbitrum ETH to pay for the network transaction fees.

### Getting testnet ETH

[https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia) dispenses a small amount of ETH.

- Select Arbitrum and Sepolia from the dropdowns.
- Connect your MetaMask to complete the wallet address field.
- Optionally you can tweet to double the amount of test `ETH` you will receive.
(note: the faucet might say ARB, but your MetaMask will say ETH 🤷‍♀️🤷🏼‍♂️)

Alternatively, you can use the [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) to get some ETH.

## Getting testnet USDC 

Getting USDC in Sepolia (or any other testnet network) is quick and simple. Just visit the [Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/), select Arbitrum Sepolia (or any other network) and paste your address. You can get 10 USDC per day.
