# How to add networks to MetaMask

The Nevermined App is currently available on 4 blockchain networks:
- [Arbitrum](https://nevermined.app/) - This is the **main network** for the Nevermined App.
- [Polygon](https://matic.nevermined.app/)
- [Gnosis](https://gnosis.nevermined.app/)
- [Peaq](https://peaq.nevermined.app/)

Depending on the network you prefer to use, you need to add some network data to your MetaMask wallet.

For testing purposes, we have also deployed the application on the [Arbitrum Sepolia](https://testing.nevermined.app/) testnet. Using the testing environment has the benefit that you can try the application while using 'test tokens' (without any value) to pay for transaction fees.

## Get Ready

Before you add any of these networks, make sure you are logged in to your MetaMask.
Go to the extension menu in your browser, click on the MetaMask icon and log in with your password.


## Step 1: Go to 'Add Network'

- Click the Circle icon in the top right corner of the app.
- From the dropdown menu, select "Settings".

- Scroll to the bottom and click on the blue "Add Network" button.
