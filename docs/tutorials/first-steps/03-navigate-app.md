### Dashboard

Shows at a glance a summary of your activity in the app. You will be able to see the number of things you have published, the number of subscriptions purchased, the revenue generated by the subscriptions you sold, etc.

### My Assets

It shows all the different assets you have published in the app. You can search and filter them by different parameters or metadata (asset type, publication date, etc.). You can also search for a specific asset by name.

### My Plans

Shows all the subscription plans you have published in the app. By clicking on a subscription, you can see all the assets, like AI web services, associated to that subscription. This association means when a subscription is purchased, all the assets associated to that subscription are available to the subscribed user.

### My Account

Allows you to configure your account information like the profile picture, name, email, etc. Also if you are an AI builder and you plan to publish AI services in the app, you will be able to configure your preferred method to receive payments. Your choices are through Nevermined's Stripe integration for remuneration in fiat, or via Nevermined's crypto remuneration mechanism.
