# How to login?

You can log into the Nevermined App using your social credentials such as email or another social network account.

## Choose your method of authentication

- Click "Log in+" button at the top right of the app.
- Choose one of the available authentication methods and click "Continue".
- You will then navigate to an external authentication process (Google, Github, other).

After you have successfully logged in, you will see the success message:

If it's the first time you log into the app, you will initiate the account creation process. If, however, you are a returning user, you will be be ready to use the app right away.

Please note, that if you use a wallet to sign in, the first time you connect you will be asked to sign a message with your MetaMask wallet. This is optional, but it will help us keep you up-to-date.

And that's it! You are now logged in to the Nevermined App and ready to start using it.
