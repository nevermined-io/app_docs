# How to login?

You can log into the Nevermined App using your social credentials such as email or another social network account.

If you want to play around with the app you can use the <ins>[Nevermined App on the Testing environment](https://testing.nevermined.app/)</ins>, if you want to use the app for real you can use the <ins>[Nevermined App on Live](https://nevermined.app/)</ins>.

## Choose your method of authentication

- Go to the Nevermined App on <ins>[Testing](https://testing.nevermined.app/)</ins> or <ins>[Live](https://nevermined.app/)</ins> environments.
- Click "Log in" button at the top right of the app.
- Choose one of the available authentication methods and click "Continue".
- You will then navigate to an external authentication process (Google, Github, other).

After you have successfully logged in, you will be redirected back to the app. In this case you will notice the header of the app changed. Now you can see more options in the header, such as "Dashboard" and the "New +" button.

If instead of "Sign-in" you click on "Join", you will initiate the account creation process. If, however, you are a returning user, you will be be ready to use the app right away.

Please note, that if you use a wallet to sign in, the first time you connect you will be asked to sign a message with your MetaMask wallet. This is optional, but it will help us keep you up-to-date.

And that's it! You are now logged in to the Nevermined App and ready to start using it.
