# What Nevermined App does?

## NFT Subscription Features

Features include the ability to create a time-locked NFT, NFT price setting (right now in USDC but can support any ERC20) and to register assets, either web services (i.e. APIs for AI agents and the services the agents will consume) or data for context that the AIs will use. These registered assets can then be appended to your subscription and access managed based on the time-lock and price setting (i.e. time-based tokengating).

## Asset Registration

Registration for services takes in the web service / agent endpoint and JWT and encrypts the information.

Registration for datasets walks publishers through a simple upload flow.

The result are DIDs created per asset and associated with the Publisher’s wallet, that can then be linked to a subscription(s) of the Publisher’s choosing.

## NFT Purchases

To purchase the subscription NFT, we have a basic marketplace to search and discover subscriptions and assets. Alternatively, we've created an NFT Subscription widget that you can embed in your own real estate, like your website, and your users can purchase the NFT from there. 

Once purchase is made, they are routed to the NVM app (in the case they are consuming from the widget) and can redeem access to the endpoint(s) / service(s) and / or the dataset(s) attached to that subscription.

## Nevermined Subscriptions give AI Agents Superpowers!

Now AI agents have a means to monetize and to transact with external services without the need for a PoS or credit card. In other words, we've given agents (and associated services) a payment gateway and tokengating superpowers.

Request-lock subscriptions will be released soon after the time-lock version so instead of having a subscription for a period of time, you can limit the number of requests to the service.

Given that AI agents won't have bank accounts, we think this approach is super powerful and will provide the basis for a future of AI Agent-to-Agent transactions.
