# Payments for AI Agents and Apps

What can you do with the Nevermined Payments App?

AI payments are hard. Price your AI agent too low and you may be stuck with a hefty OpenAI bill.
Price your AI agent too high and you won't be competitive. Nevermined allows you to take control
over your pricing and connect it to actual app usage.

## Create Payment Plans

Payment Plans give AI Builders the ability to control how and when users can use an AI agent or
service. They are entirely controlled and managed by the AI Builder that creates them with no
interference from Nevermined.

As an AI Builder, you can create a Payment Plan for your AI that gives you the ability to:

- Create a time-based or request-based access token, called Credits, for your AI
- Set a price, starting from Free, to access your AI (supporting any type of currency)
- Combine different AI agent services, like API web services for your AI, data sets for context,
  model weights for training, etc.
- Set the number of Credits required to access a particular AI service, giving the Builder even
  greater pricing flexibility for each unique AI service, dataset, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your Payment Plans, ensure you have:

- A registered AI agent with an HTTP endpoint
- A Nevermined account
- (Optional) A Stripe account for fiat payments

## Time-Based vs. Request-Based Access to AIs

Nevermined Payment Plans enable the setup of time-based or request-based gating of a Builder's AI.

- Time-Based: Provisions user access with time-gating. Builders can set the time period that a user
  will be allowed access to the AI. For example, this could be 1 year, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day, 1
  hour, etc. When a user makes a request, the corresponding access credit will be redeemed and grant
  that user access to the AI service for the period designated by the Builder. Once the time period
  has elapsed, the user will no longer have access, and will need to redeem another credit if
  additional access is required.
- Request-Based: Provisions user access with request-gating. In this case, Builders can manage the
  number of requests that a user can make to access their AI service. This is done by prompting the
  Builder to set the number of Credits needed to make a request to the AI service/app when they
  add that service to a Payment Plan package. Once set, each time a request is made by a user,
  Nevermined will redeem the specified number of Credits needed to make the request. If the user
  does not have enough Credits, they will be prompted to purchase more Credits and denied access to
  the Builder's AI service/app.

## AI Credits

The Nevermined Credits system is a sophisticated backend SaaS component that gives AI Builders
flexibility to monitor and manage usage of their AI agent and apps. Credits are sold to users and
then redeemed for access to the AI service, dataset, etc. How these Credits are redeemed is set by
the AI Builder. Nevermined then manages the redemption on their behalf with no additional work
required from the AI Builder.

## Registering an AI Agent/App

You can register AI web services in just a few easy steps through Nevermined's simple registration
flow.

To register an AI, you will need:
- Your AI's web services endpoint
- A JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
- A unique identifier for your service

The Nevermined app encrypts this information for security. The outcome of the registration process
is an AI identification number, called a Decentralized Identifier (DID), that is associated with
each Builder. These AI services can then be linked to your Payment Plan(s).

## Type of Payment

Nevermined supports two major types of purchase: fiat/cash purchases and crypto purchases. AI
Builders are given the choice of the purchase type they want to support. This selection is done when
setting up a Builder profile within the Nevermined app. Once selected, the purchase type(s) will be
propagated through to each Payment Plan that the AI Builder creates. Then, when a user subscribes,
they will be presented with the default purchase types.

## Stripe Subscription

When an AI Builder selects Stripe as the purchase mechanism for their Payment Plans, they will be
asked to go through the Stripe onboarding flow. This flow is independent from the Nevermined app
and is required to open an account with Stripe.

## Buying Payment Plans with User Checkout Flow

We've created a Payment Plan widget that AI Builders can embed in their own websites or platforms,
so users can purchase the Payment Plan from there. The purchase flow operates like PayPal, routing the user
through Nevermined's Checkout flow service. During this flow, users will choose how they wish to
make the purchase, depending on the payment options made available by the AI Builder. Once a
purchase is made, the user's account will be updated with the new Credits and can then start using
the corresponding AI service or agent.

People that buy from a widget will be routed to the Nevermined access flow. This is where they can
redeem access to the AI web service's endpoint that is included in the Payment Plan.

## Payment Plans give AI Agents Superpowers!

Payment Plans enable AI agents to monetize and perform transactions with external services. This integration
provides agents and associated services with powerful payment capabilities.
