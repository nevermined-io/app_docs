# Getting Started

## Select which library flavour to use

Depending on where you want to integrate the library and the application you want to build, you can choose between the Python or Typescript library:

- **Python**: Github repository [nevermined-io/payments-py](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py) and [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/payments-py/)
- **Typescript**: Github repository [nevermined-io/payments](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments) and [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nevermined-io/payments)

:::info
Both Payments libraries implementations are Open Source ([Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)).
:::

## Requirements

## Get a Nevermined API Key

To use the Payments libraries you need to [create a Nevermined API Key](../tutorials/integration/nvm-api-keys). This key will allow you to interact with the Nevermined platform and create Payment Plans and Agents.

The Nevermined API Key must be created in the environment where you will run your application. For example, if you are running a Python application connected to the **"testing"**, you need to create the API Key in the [Nevermined Testing App](https://testing.nevermined.app/) but if you want to use the Live environment you must use the [Nevermined App](https://nevermined.app/).

:::warning
You need to keep your API Key secure and never share it with anyone.

  # If you want to connect to production use 'arbitrum' as environment
  payments = Payments(nvm_api_key, environment=Environment.get_environment('testing'))  # 'local' | 'staging' | 'testing' | 'arbitrum' | 'peaq' | 'custom'
  ```

  // If you want to connect to production use 'arbitrum' as environment
