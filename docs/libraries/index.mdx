# Payment Libraries

## Introduction

The Nevermined Payment Libraries are software components that can be used to augment AI applications.

Payment Libraries allow AI Builders to monetize their AI Applications (like AI Agents or Services), integrate some other AI applications and query them in a generic way.

:::info 
The Payment libraries are <ins>Open Source</ins> ([Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). 
:::

The libraries are provided in [Python](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py) and
[Typescript](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments).

Both language implementations provide the same API but the Python one is more suited for AI
Builders, Data Scientists and/or Data engineers.

From the other side, the Typescript implementation can be used for building AI agents/services too
and for be integrated in frontend applications.
