# Payment Libraries

## Introduction

The Nevermined Payment Libraries are software components that enable AI Builders to create and monetize AI applications.

Payment Libraries allow AI Builders to monetize their AI Applications (such as AI Agents or Services), integrate external AI applications, and query them in a standardized way.

:::info 
The Payment Libraries are <ins>Open Source</ins> ([Apache v2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). 
:::

The libraries are provided in [Python](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py) and
[TypeScript](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments).

Both language implementations provide the same API but the Python one is more suited for AI
Builders, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers.

The TypeScript implementation can be used for building AI Agents/Services and for integration in frontend applications.

## Main Features

- Create Pricing Plans
- Register AI Agents and Services
- Register assets with associated files (Models, Datasets, etc.)
- Discover Pricing Plans and AI Agents
- Order Pricing Plans giving access to AI Agents, files, etc.
- Query AI Agents programmatically
- Build AI Agents able to process tasks sent by users
