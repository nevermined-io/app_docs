# Examples

The Payment Libraries allow you to interact with the Nevermined platform to create and manage Payment Plans and AI Agents.

## AI Agents

### Youtube Agent (Python)

The Youtube Summarizer it's a small Python AI Agent with Nevermined Payments Library integrated which receives a Youtube video URL and returns a summary of the transcription of the video.

The Agent uses LangChain to retrieve the transcription and summarize it via OpenAI integration.

Here is the [Youtube Summarizer Agent code](https://github.com/nevermined-io/youtube-agent/).
